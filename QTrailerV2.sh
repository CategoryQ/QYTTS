# v0.2 - complete reworking of proof of concept version
# #####################################################
#
# This script will scrape your Kodi library for movie titles, then search
# YouTube for it's trailer. It'll download the trailers to a specified
# directory, which is used by the Cinema Experience script for Kodi to
# load trailers. This way you can see the trailers for films you own, 
# withought having to dea with all the buffering that comes from streaming.
#
# I know there are other tools out there to get trailers for your library,
# but most were windows based. The ones that weren't would just grab trailers
# for any film, whether you have it or not.
#
# This was designed for my original Raspberry Pi Model B, running OSMC.
# As such, it'll probably run on any Linux Kodi setup.
#
#
# -----
# Usage
# -----
# Ensure all configuration options below are set correctly, then just
# run the script as the same user that runs Kodi. 
# No arguments need
#
# ------------
# Dependencies
# ------------
# bash shell environment
# sqlite3 (most distro's will have this in their repo)
# youtube-dl (available at https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ )
