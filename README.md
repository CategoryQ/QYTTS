QsYouTubeTrailerScraper - QYTTS v0.5

This script will scrape your Kodi library for movie titles, then search
YouTube for it's trailer. It'll download the trailers to a specified
directory, which is used by the Cinema Experience script for Kodi to
load trailers. This way you can see the trailers for films you own, 
withought having to dea with all the buffering that comes from streaming.

I know there are other tools out there to get trailers for your library,
but most were windows based. The ones that weren't would just grab trailers
for any film, whether you have it or not.

This was designed for my original Raspberry Pi Model B, running OSMC.
As such, it'll probably run on any Linux Kodi setup.

Known Issues
------------
Grabbing entire films

Due to the simplicity of this script, it will grab the first YouTube result
after searching for the movie name + "trailer". In the case of some films - 
mostly older or independent films - the first result on youtube will be
the complete film. To avoid this issue, there are 2 countermeasures - it
will check the title of the YouTube video to ensure it contains the word
"Trailer" (case insensitive). Secondly, after downloading it checks if it
is larger than the maximum file size (default is 100MB), and if it is too 
large then deletes the file. Unfortunately I have no way to check file size
before downloading, so looking at extra ways of avoiding unnecessary 
bandwidth usage...
