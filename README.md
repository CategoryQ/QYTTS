QsYouTubeTrailerScraper - QYTTS
v0.2 - complete reworking of proof of concept version

This script will scrape your Kodi library for movie titles, then search
YouTube for it's trailer. It'll download the trailers to a specified
directory, which is used by the Cinema Experience script for Kodi to
load trailers. This way you can see the trailers for films you own, 
withought having to dea with all the buffering that comes from streaming.
I know there are other tools out there to get trailers for your library,
but most were windows based. The ones that weren't would just grab trailers
for any film, whether you have it or not.
This was designed for my original Raspberry Pi Model B, running OSMC.
As such, it'll probably run on any Linux Kodi setup.
